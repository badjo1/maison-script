# MaisonScript

At the Walenweeshuis on Vijzelgracht number 2, there is a plaque from 1921 commemorating its 250th anniversary. This plaque features unique lettering that does not exist in any current font.

We have carefully recreated these distinctive letters, and where characters were missing, we have done our best to complete them. This process led to the creation of **MaisonScript** (see the included `.ttf` file).

The concept behind MaisonScript is to assign each individual letter and number an ordinal, allowing for the creation of new jubilee texts that honor the past while opening up new applications in the modern, digital age.

## Usage

1. Download and install the `.ttf` file to use the MaisonScript font in your projects.
2. Use the unique ordinals of the letters and numbers to creatively craft new jubilee texts.

## Example

Here is an example of the original plaque that inspired this project:
